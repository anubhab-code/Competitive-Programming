{"title":"B. Unlucky Ticket","contestId":"160","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">even</span> number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.</p><p>But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let&apos;s consider the following <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">unluckiness criterion</span> that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We&apos;ll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly less</span> than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly more</span> than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such <span class=\"tex-font-style-underline\">bijective correspondence</span> between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly less</span> than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">strictly more</span> than the corresponding digit from the second half.</p><p>For example, ticket <span class=\"tex-span\">2421</span> meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is <span class=\"tex-span\">2&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">4&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2</span>), ticket <span class=\"tex-span\">0135</span> also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is <span class=\"tex-span\">0&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;3</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;5</span>), and ticket <span class=\"tex-span\">3754</span> does not meet the criterion. </p><p>You have a ticket in your hands, it contains <span class=\"tex-span\">2<i>n</i></span> digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;100</span>).
