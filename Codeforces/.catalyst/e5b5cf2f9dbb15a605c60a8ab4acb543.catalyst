You need to find for each query the sum of elements of the array with indexes from $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$, inclusive.</p><p>The little girl found the problem rather boring. She decided to reorder the array elements before replying to the queries in a way that makes the sum of query replies maximum possible.
