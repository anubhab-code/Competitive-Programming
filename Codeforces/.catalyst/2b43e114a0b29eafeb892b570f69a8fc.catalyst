Each square is initially either clean or dirty. Ohana can sweep her broom over columns of the grid. Her broom is very strange: if she sweeps over a clean square, it will become dirty, and if she sweeps over a dirty square, it will become clean. She wants to sweep some columns of the room to maximize the number of rows that are completely clean.
