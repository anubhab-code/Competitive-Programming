Overall the stadium has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> balls and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> baskets. The baskets are positioned in a row from left to right and they are numbered with numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span>, correspondingly. The balls are numbered with numbers from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>.</p><p>Valeric decided to sort the balls in the order of increasing of their numbers by the following scheme. He will put each new ball in the basket with the least number of balls. And if he&apos;s got several variants, he chooses the basket which stands closer to the middle. That means that he chooses the basket for which <img align=\"middle\" class=\"tex-formula\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/f9d0b92b5db1d7995ab93882f3948ffd8b213597.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> is minimum, where <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> is the number of the basket.
