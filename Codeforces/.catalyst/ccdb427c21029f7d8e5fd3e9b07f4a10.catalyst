A multiple-choice question consists of four choices: <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>. Each choice has a description, and the child should find out the only one that is correct.</p><p>Fortunately the child knows how to solve such complicated test. The child will follow the algorithm:</p><ul> <li> If there is some choice whose description at least twice shorter than all other descriptions, or at least twice longer than all other descriptions, then the child thinks the choice is great. </li><li> If there is exactly one great choice then the child chooses it. Otherwise the child chooses <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span> (the child think it is the luckiest choice). </li></ul><p>You are given a multiple-choice questions, can you predict child&apos;s choose?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line starts with &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A.</span>&quot; (without quotes), then followed the description of choice <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>.

They are given in order: <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">D</span>. <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Please note</span>, that the description goes after prefix &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">X.</span>&quot;, so the prefix mustn&apos;t be counted in description&apos;s length.</p><p>Each description is non-empty and consists of at most <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span> characters.
