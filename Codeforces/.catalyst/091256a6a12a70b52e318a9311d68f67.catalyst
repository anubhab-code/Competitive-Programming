{"title":"D. Let&apos;s Go Hiking","contestId":"1496","problemIndex":"D","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>On a weekend, Qingshan suggests that she and her friend Daniel go hiking. Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.</p><p>A permutation $$$p$$$ is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le n$$$) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le y\\le n$$$, $$$y \\ne x$$$).</p><p>The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow: </p><ul> <li> If it is Qingshan&apos;s turn, Qingshan must change $$$x$$$ to such an index $$$x&apos;$$$ that $$$1\\le x&apos;\\le n$$$, $$$|x&apos;-x|=1$$$, $$$x&apos;\\ne y$$$, and $$$p_{x&apos;}&lt;p_x$$$ at the same time. </li><li> If it is Daniel&apos;s turn, Daniel must change $$$y$$$ to such an index $$$y&apos;$$$ that $$$1\\le y&apos;\\le n$$$, $$$|y&apos;-y|=1$$$, $$$y&apos;\\ne x$$$, and $$$p_{y&apos;}&gt;p_y$$$ at the same time. </li></ul><p>The person who can&apos;t make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan&apos;s fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible $$$x$$$ to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the permutation.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print the number of possible values of $$$x$$$ that Qingshan can choose to make her win.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first test case, Qingshan can only choose $$$x=3$$$ to win, so the answer is $$$1$$$.</p><p>In the second test case, if Qingshan will choose $$$x=4$$$, Daniel can choose $$$y=1$$$. In the first turn (Qingshan&apos;s) Qingshan chooses $$$x&apos;=3$$$ and changes $$$x$$$ to $$$3$$$. In the second turn (Daniel&apos;s) Daniel chooses $$$y&apos;=2$$$ and changes $$$y$$$ to $$$2$$$. Qingshan can&apos;t choose $$$x&apos;=2$$$ because $$$y=2$$$ at this time. Then Qingshan loses.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1625659428900,"input":"5\n1 2 5 4 3\n","output":"1\n"},{"id":1625659428901,"input":"7\n1 2 4 6 5 3 7\n","output":"0\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1496/submit","language":"python"}
