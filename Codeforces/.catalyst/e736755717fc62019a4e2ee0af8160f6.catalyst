Just make a formal statement.&quot; Because of this, Omkar gives you an array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$ of $$$n$$$ distinct integers. An array $$$b = [b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k]$$$ is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nice</span> if for any two distinct elements $$$b_i, b_j$$$ of $$$b$$$, $$$|b_i-b_j|$$$ appears in $$$b$$$ at least once. In addition, all elements in $$$b$$$ must be distinct. Can you add several (maybe, $$$0$$$) integers to $$$a$$$ to create a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nice</span> array $$$b$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">of size at most $$$300$$$</span>? If $$$a$$$ is already <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nice</span>, you don&apos;t have to add any elements.</p><p>For example, array $$$[3, 6, 9]$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nice</span>, as $$$|6-3|=|9-6| = 3$$$, which appears in the array, and $$$|9-3| = 6$$$, which appears in the array, while array $$$[4, 2, 0, 6, 9]$$$ is not <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">nice</span>, as $$$|9-4| = 5$$$ is not present in the array.</p><p>For integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, $$$|x-y| = x-y$$$ if $$$x &gt; y$$$ and $$$|x-y| = y-x$$$ otherwise.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
