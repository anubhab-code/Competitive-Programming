The $$$n$$$ miners can be regarded as $$$n$$$ points <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">on the y-axis</span>. There are $$$n$$$ diamond mines in the mining area.

For some reason, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">no miners or diamond mines can be at the origin</span> (point $$$(0, 0)$$$). </p><p>Every miner should mine <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> one diamond mine. Every miner has a hook, which can be used to mine a diamond mine. If a miner at the point $$$(a,b)$$$ uses his hook to mine a diamond mine at the point $$$(c,d)$$$, he will spend $$$\\sqrt{(a-c)^2+(b-d)^2}$$$ energy to mine it (the distance between these points).
