Manao&apos;s monitor has a square screen. The movie has 3:2 horizontal to vertical length ratio. Obviously, the movie occupies most of the screen if the width of the picture coincides with the width of the screen. In this case, only 2/3 of the monitor will project the movie in the horizontal dimension: <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/ce823413ad27813e27496a0d8bd4231e94b47662.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"></p><p>Sample 2.
