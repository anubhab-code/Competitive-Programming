For instance, he learned that the Russian word &quot;tma&quot; (which now means &quot;too much to be counted&quot;) used to stand for a thousand and &quot;tma tmyschaya&quot; (which literally means &quot;the tma of tmas&quot;) used to stand for a million.</p><p>Petya wanted to modernize the words we use for numbers and invented a word <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium</span> that represents number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>. Moreover, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium la petricium</span> stands for number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">2</sup></span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petricium la petricium la petricium</span> stands for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup></span> and so on. All numbers of this form are called <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petriciumus cifera</span>, and the number&apos;s importance is the number of articles <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">la</span> in its title.</p><p>Petya&apos;s invention brought on a challenge that needed to be solved quickly: does some number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i></span> belong to the set <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">petriciumus cifera</span>?
