{"title":"A. Sum of Round Numbers","contestId":"1352","problemIndex":"A","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">round</span> if it is of the form <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">d00...0</span>. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ (inclusive) are round.</p><p>For example, the following numbers are round: $$$4000$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$800$$$, $$$90$$$. The following numbers are <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> round: $$$110$$$, $$$707$$$, $$$222$$$, $$$1001$$$.</p><p>You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^4$$$). Represent the number $$$n$$$ as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number $$$n$$$ as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases in the input.

Each answer must begin with an integer $$$k$$$ &#x2014; the minimum number of summands. Next, $$$k$$$ terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is $$$n$$$. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.</p>","noteHtml":null,"sampleTestcases":[{"id":1625977807667,"input":"5\n5009\n7\n9876\n10000\n10\n","output":"2\n5000 9\n1\n7 \n4\n800 70 6 9000 \n1\n10000 \n1\n10 \n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1352/submit","language":"python"}
