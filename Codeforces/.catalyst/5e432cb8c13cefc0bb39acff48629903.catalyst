Diverse Matrix","contestId":"1266","problemIndex":"C","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Let $$$a$$$ be a matrix of size $$$r \\times c$$$ containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$r$$$, columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$c$$$. We can construct an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$r + c$$$ integers as follows: for each $$$i \\in [1, r]$$$, let $$$b_i$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$i$$$-th row, and for each $$$j \\in [1, c]$$$ let $$$b_{r+j}$$$ be the greatest common divisor of integers in the $$$j$$$-th column. </p><p>We call the matrix <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">diverse</span> if all $$$r + c$$$ numbers $$$b_k$$$ ($$$k \\in [1, r + c]$$$) are pairwise distinct. </p><p>The <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">magnitude</span> of a matrix equals to the maximum of $$$b_k$$$.</p><p>For example, suppose we have the following matrix:</p><center> $$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 9 &amp; 7\\\\ 4 &amp; 144 &amp; 84 \\end{pmatrix}$$$ </center><p>We construct the array $$$b$$$:</p><ol> <li> $$$b_1$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$7$$$, that is $$$1$$$; </li><li> $$$b_2$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$4$$$, $$$144$$$, and $$$84$$$, that is $$$4$$$; </li><li> $$$b_3$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, that is $$$2$$$; </li><li> $$$b_4$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$9$$$ and $$$144$$$, that is $$$9$$$; </li><li> $$$b_5$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$84$$$, that is $$$7$$$. </li></ol><p>So $$$b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]$$$. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to $$$9$$$.</p><p>For a given $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least $$$1$$$, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size $$$2 \\times 2$$$ with magnitude smaller than $$$4$$$.</p><p>In the second example, no matter what $$$a_{1,1}$$$ is, $$$b_1 = b_2$$$ will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1625891296987,"input":"2 2\n","output":"4 12\n2 9"},{"id":1625891296988,"input":"1 1\n","output":"0\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"python"}
