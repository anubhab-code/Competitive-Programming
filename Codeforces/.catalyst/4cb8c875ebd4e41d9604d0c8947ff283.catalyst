There also exists Great Gena&apos;s code, written in 2016. The problem this code solves is: given the number of tanks that go into the battle from each country, find their product. If it is turns to be too large, then the servers might have not enough time to assign tanks into teams and the whole game will collapse!</p><p>There are exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> distinct countries in the world and the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th country added <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> tanks to the game. As the developers of the game are perfectionists, the number of tanks from each country is beautiful. A <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">beautiful</span> number, according to the developers, is such number that its decimal representation consists only of digits &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&apos; and &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>&apos;, moreover it contains <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most one</span> digit &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&apos;.
