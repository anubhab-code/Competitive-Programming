There will be many necessary events tomorrow, the $$$i$$$-th of them will start during the $$$x_i$$$-th minute. Ivan doesn&apos;t want to skip any of the events, so he has to set his alarm clock in such a way that it rings during minutes $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$, so he will be awake during each of these minutes (<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">note that it does not matter if his alarm clock will ring during any other minute</span>).</p><p>Ivan can choose two properties for the alarm clock &#x2014; the first minute it will ring (let&apos;s denote it as $$$y$$$) and the interval between two consecutive signals (let&apos;s denote it by $$$p$$$). After the clock is set, it will ring during minutes $$$y, y + p, y + 2p, y + 3p$$$ and so on.</p><p>Ivan can choose <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any</span> minute as the first one, but he cannot choose any arbitrary value of $$$p$$$. He has to pick it among the given values $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$$$ (his phone does not support any other options for this setting).</p><p>So Ivan has to choose the first minute $$$y$$$ when the alarm clock should start ringing and the interval between two consecutive signals $$$p_j$$$ in such a way that it will ring during all given minutes $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ (and it does not matter if his alarm clock will ring in any other minutes).</p><p>Your task is to tell the first minute $$$y$$$ and the index $$$j$$$ such that if Ivan sets his alarm clock with properties $$$y$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ it will ring during all given minutes $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ or say that it is impossible to choose such values of the given properties.
