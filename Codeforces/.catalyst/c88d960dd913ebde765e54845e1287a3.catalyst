{"title":"B. Sasha and Magnetic Machines","contestId":"1113","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>One day Sasha visited the farmer 2D and his famous magnetic farm. On this farm, the crop grows due to the influence of a special magnetic field. Maintaining of the magnetic field is provided by $$$n$$$ machines, and the power of the $$$i$$$-th machine is $$$a_i$$$. </p><p>This year 2D decided to cultivate a new culture, but what exactly he didn&apos;t say. For the successful growth of the new culture, it is necessary to slightly change the powers of the machines. 2D can <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most once</span> choose an arbitrary integer $$$x$$$, then choose one machine and reduce the power of its machine by $$$x$$$ times, and at the same time increase the power of one another machine by $$$x$$$ times (powers of all the machines must stay <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">positive integers</span>). Note that he may not do that if he wants. More formally, 2D can choose two such indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, and one integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x$$$ is a divisor of $$$a_i$$$, and change powers as following: $$$a_i = \\frac{a_i}{x}$$$, $$$a_j = a_j \\cdot x$$$</p><p>Sasha is very curious, that&apos;s why he wants to calculate the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> total power the farmer can reach. There are too many machines, and Sasha can&apos;t cope with computations, help him!</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of machines.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the powers of the machines.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print one integer&#xA0;&#x2014; minimum total power.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example, the farmer can reduce the power of the $$$4$$$-th machine by $$$2$$$ times, and increase the power of the $$$1$$$-st machine by $$$2$$$ times, then the powers will be: $$$[2, 2, 3, 2, 5]$$$.</p><p>In the second example, the farmer can reduce the power of the $$$3$$$-rd machine by $$$2$$$ times, and increase the power of the $$$2$$$-nd machine by $$$2$$$ times.
