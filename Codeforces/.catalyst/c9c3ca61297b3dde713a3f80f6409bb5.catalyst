You are going to type the string $$$s$$$ character by character, from the first character to the last one.</p><p>When typing a character, instead of pressing the button corresponding to it, you can press the &quot;Backspace&quot; button. It deletes the last character you have typed among those that aren&apos;t deleted yet (or does nothing if there are no characters in the current string). For example, if $$$s$$$ is &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abcbd</span>&quot; and you press Backspace instead of typing the first and the fourth characters, you will get the string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bd</span>&quot; (the first press of Backspace deletes no character, and the second press deletes the character &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>&apos;). Another example, if $$$s$$$ is &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abcaa</span>&quot; and you press Backspace instead of the last two letters, then the resulting text is &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;.</p><p>Your task is to determine whether you can obtain the string $$$t$$$, if you type the string $$$s$$$ and press &quot;Backspace&quot; instead of typing several (maybe zero) characters of $$$s$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^5$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$$$).
