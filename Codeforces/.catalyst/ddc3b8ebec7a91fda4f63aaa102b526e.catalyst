{"title":"B. Fox Dividing Cheese","contestId":"371","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"1 second","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That&apos;s where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: &quot;Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal&quot; &quot;Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?&quot;, the curious bears asked. &quot;It&apos;s easy&quot;, said the fox. &quot;If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I&apos;ll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal&quot;. </p><p>The little bears realize that the fox&apos;s proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two space-separated integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>a</i>,&#x2009;<i>b</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>). </p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">-1</span>.
