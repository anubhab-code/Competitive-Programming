That is a problem for the organizers because they want a winner. </p><p>While watching previous races the organizers have noticed that Willman can perform <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">only</span> steps of length equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>w</i></span> meters, and Bolt can perform <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">only</span> steps of length equal to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>b</i></span> meters. Organizers decided to slightly change the rules of the race. Now, at the end of the racetrack there will be an abyss, and the winner will be declared the athlete, who manages to run farther from the starting point of the the racetrack (which is not the subject to change by any of the athletes). </p><p>Note that none of the athletes can run infinitely far, as they both will at some moment of time face the point, such that only one step further will cause them to fall in the abyss. In other words, the athlete <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">will not</span> fall into the abyss if the total length of all his steps will be less or equal to the chosen distance <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i></span>.</p><p>Since the organizers are very fair, the are going to set the length of the racetrack as an integer chosen randomly and uniformly in range from 1 to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>t</i></span> (both are included).
