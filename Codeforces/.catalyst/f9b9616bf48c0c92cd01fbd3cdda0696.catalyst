He has set up coordinate axes, and he wants the sides of the rectangle to be parallel to them. Of course, the area of the rectangle must be positive. Wilbur had all four vertices of the planned pool written on a paper, until his friend came along and erased some of the vertices.</p><p>Now Wilbur is wondering, if the remaining <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> vertices of the initial rectangle give enough information to restore the area of the planned swimming pool.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;4</span>)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of vertices that were <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> erased by Wilbur&apos;s friend.</p><p>Each of the following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> lines contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">&#x2009;-&#x2009;1000&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>x</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,&#x2009;<i>y</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1000</span>)&#xA0;&#x2014;the coordinates of the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th vertex that remains.
