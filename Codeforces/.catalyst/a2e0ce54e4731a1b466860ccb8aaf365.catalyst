At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. </p><p>The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.</p><p>A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards&#x2019; ranks are.
