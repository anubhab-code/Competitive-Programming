He decided to put them away to the closet and hang on the wall a famous painter&apos;s picture. Polycarpus does it like that: he goes from the left to the right and removes the objects consecutively. As Polycarpus doesn&apos;t want any mix-ups to happen, he will not carry in his hands objects of two different types. In other words, Polycarpus can&apos;t carry both postcards and photos simultaneously. Sometimes he goes to the closet and puts the objects there, thus leaving his hands free. Polycarpus must put <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> the postcards and photos to the closet. He cannot skip objects. What minimum number of times he should visit the closet if he cannot carry more than 5 items?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The only line of the input data contains a non-empty string consisting of letters <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">&quot;&#x421;&quot;</span> and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">&quot;P&quot;</span> whose length does not exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span> characters.
