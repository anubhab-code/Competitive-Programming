The quiz consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> consecutive questions. A correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of consecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the number on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question incorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If after an answer the counter reaches the number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i></span>, then it is reset, and the player&apos;s score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to the player&apos;s score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of the game, both the player&apos;s score and the counter of consecutive correct answers are set to zero.</p><p>Manao remembers that he has answered exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>m</i></span> questions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions came. He&apos;s trying to figure out what his minimum score may be.

If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points.</p><p>Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4.</p><p>Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo <span class=\"tex-span\">1000000009</span>. For example, if Manao could obtain either <span class=\"tex-span\">2000000000</span> or <span class=\"tex-span\">2000000020</span> points, the answer is <span class=\"tex-span\">2000000000&#xA0;<i>mod</i>&#xA0;1000000009</span>, even though <span class=\"tex-span\">2000000020&#xA0;<i>mod</i>&#xA0;1000000009</span> is a smaller number.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1628257967807,"input":"5 3 2\n","output":"3\n"},{"id":1628257967808,"input":"5 4 2\n","output":"6\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"python"}
