Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.</p><p>Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> products will be put up for sale and exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren&apos;t any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren&apos;t kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.</p><p>For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i></span> days from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> next for sell-outs. On each of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i></span> chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day shop planned to put up for sale <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep <span class=\"tex-span\">2&#xB7;<i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.</p><p>Noora&apos;s task is to choose <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i></span> days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>f</i></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">5</sup>,&#x2009;0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>f</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>)</span> denoting the number of days in shop&apos;s plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.</p><p>Each line of the following <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> subsequent lines contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,&#x2009;<i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> <span class=\"tex-span\">(0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>k</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>,&#x2009;<i>l</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup>)</span> denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example we can choose days with numbers <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">4</span> for sell-out.
