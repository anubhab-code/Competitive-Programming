The game is played by two persons: operator and player. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath one of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player has to guess the current position of the ball.</p><p>Bomboslav noticed that guys are not very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the middle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the middle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).</p><p>Let&apos;s number shells from <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> from left to right. Thus the left shell is assigned number <span class=\"tex-span\">0</span>, the middle shell is <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and the right shell is <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>. Bomboslav has missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows that exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> movements were made by the operator and the ball was under shell <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> at the end.
