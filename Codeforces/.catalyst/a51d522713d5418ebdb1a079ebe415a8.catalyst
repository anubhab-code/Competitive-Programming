So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">Soroban</span> &#x2014; an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let&apos;s have a look at the Soroban&apos;s construction.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/c89d840feb7a00e1533b72e95915d7c6775a77b7.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>Soroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">go-dama</span> and four others are <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">ichi-damas</span>. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:</p><ul> <li> Set the value of a digit equal to 0. </li><li> If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. </li><li> Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. </li></ul><p>Thus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.</p><p>Write the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">0&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>).</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print the description of the decimal digits of number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement)</span>, one per line.

Print as many rods, as many digits are in the decimal representation of number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> without leading zeroes.
