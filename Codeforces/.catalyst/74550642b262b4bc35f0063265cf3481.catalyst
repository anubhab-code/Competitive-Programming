{"title":"B. Love Song","contestId":"1539","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up $$$q$$$ questions about this song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the $$$l$$$-th letter to the $$$r$$$-th letter. Vasya considers a substring made up from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment $$$k$$$ times, where $$$k$$$ is the index of the corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abbcb</span>&quot;, then Vasya repeats letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&apos; once, each of the letters &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>&apos; twice, letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">c</span>&quot; three times, so that the resulting string is &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abbbbcccbb</span>&quot;, its length is $$$10$$$. Vasya is interested about the length of the resulting string.</p><p>Help Petya find the length of each string obtained by Vasya.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\leq n\\leq 100\\,000$$$, $$$1\\leq q \\leq 100\\,000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the length of the song and the number of questions. </p><p>The second line contains one string $$$s$$$&#xA0;&#x2014; the song, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase letters of English letters.</p><p>Vasya&apos;s questions are contained in the next $$$q$$$ lines.

In the first question Vasya considers the substring &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">aba</span>&quot;, that transforms to &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abba</span>&quot;, so the answer is equal to $$$4$$$. In the second question Vasya considers &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">baca</span>&quot;, that transforms to &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">bbaccca</span>&quot;, so the answer is $$$7$$$.
