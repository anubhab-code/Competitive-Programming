Of course, moving the chip to the right is impossible if it is already in the last position.</p><p>After moving the chip to the right, you move it to the left several (maybe zero) times, i.&#xA0;e. you perform the following operation several times: if the current position of the chip is $$$i$$$, you move it to the position $$$i - 1$$$. Of course, moving the chip to the left is impossible if it is already in the first position.</p><p>When you place a chip or move it, you write down the character where the chip ends up after your action. For example, if $$$s$$$ is <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abcdef</span>, you place the chip onto the $$$3$$$-rd character, move it to the right $$$2$$$ times and then move it to the left $$$3$$$ times, you write down the string <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">cdedcb</span>.</p><p>You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.
