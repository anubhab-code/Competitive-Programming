{"title":"A. Haiku","contestId":"78","problemIndex":"A","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Haiku is a genre of Japanese traditional poetry.</p><p>A haiku poem consists of 17 syllables split into three phrases, containing 5, 7 and 5 syllables correspondingly (the first phrase should contain exactly 5 syllables, the second phrase should contain exactly 7 syllables, and the third phrase should contain exactly 5 syllables). A haiku masterpiece contains a description of a moment in those three phrases. Every word is important in a small poem, which is why haiku are rich with symbols. Each word has a special meaning, a special role. The main principle of haiku is to say much using a few words.</p><p>To simplify the matter, in the given problem we will consider that the number of syllable in the phrase is equal to the number of vowel letters there. Only the following letters are regarded as vowel letters: &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">a</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">e</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">i</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">o</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">u</span>&quot;.</p><p>Three phases from a certain poem are given.
