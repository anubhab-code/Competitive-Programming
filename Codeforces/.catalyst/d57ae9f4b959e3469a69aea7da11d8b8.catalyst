Here&apos;s one of them.</p><p>Two players have got a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>, consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:</p><ul> <li> The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span>. </li><li> If the player before his turn can reorder the letters in string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> so as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abba</span>&quot; is a palindrome and string &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">abc</span>&quot; isn&apos;t. </li></ul><p>Determine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well &#x2014; the one who moves first or the one who moves second.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The input contains a single line, containing string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;|<i>s</i>|&#x2009;&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;&#x2009;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">3</sup></span>).
