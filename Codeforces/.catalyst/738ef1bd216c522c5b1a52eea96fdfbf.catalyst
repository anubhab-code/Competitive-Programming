In total, there are <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> tasks for the day and each animal should do each of these tasks. For each task, they have evaluated its difficulty. Also animals decided to do the tasks in order of their difficulty. Unfortunately, some tasks can have the same difficulty, so the order in which one can perform the tasks may vary.</p><p>Menshykov, Uslada and Horace ask you to deal with this nuisance and come up with individual plans for each of them. The plan is a sequence describing the order in which an animal should do all the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> tasks. Besides, each of them wants to have its own unique plan. Therefore three plans must form three different sequences. You are to find the required plans, or otherwise deliver the sad news to them by stating that it is impossible to come up with three distinct plans for the given tasks.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;<i>n</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;2000</span>) &#x2014; the number of tasks.

That gives the total of four possible sequences of doing tasks : [1, 4, 2, 3], [4, 1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 3, 2], [4, 1, 3, 2].
