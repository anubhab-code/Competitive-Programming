Some of the square&apos;s cells are painted black and others are painted white. Your task is to repaint <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">at most one</span> cell the other color so that the picture has a <span class=\"tex-span\">2&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;2</span> square, completely consisting of cells of the same color. If the initial picture already has such a square, the person should just say so and the test will be completed. </p><p>Your task is to write a program that determines whether it is possible to pass the test.
