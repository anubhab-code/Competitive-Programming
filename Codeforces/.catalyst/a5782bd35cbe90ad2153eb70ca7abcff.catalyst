That&apos;s why when he is bored he plays with a number performing some operations.</p><p>Fangy takes some positive integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> and wants to get a number one from it. While <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> is not equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, Fangy repeats the following action: if <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> is odd, then he adds <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to it, otherwise he divides <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> by <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>. Fangy knows that for any positive integer number the process ends in finite time.</p><p>How many actions should Fangy perform to get a number one from number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span>?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a positive integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> in a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">binary system</span>.

Number <span class=\"tex-span\">101110</span> is even, which means that we should divide it by <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>. After the dividing Fangy gets an odd number <span class=\"tex-span\">10111</span> and adds one to it. Number <span class=\"tex-span\">11000</span> can be divided by <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> three times in a row and get number <span class=\"tex-span\">11</span>. All that&apos;s left is to increase the number by one (we get <span class=\"tex-span\">100</span>), and then divide it by <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> two times in a row. As a result, we get <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1625747725267,"input":"1\n","output":"0\n"},{"id":1625747725268,"input":"1001001\n","output":"12\n"},{"id":1625747725269,"input":"101110\n","output":"8\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"python"}
