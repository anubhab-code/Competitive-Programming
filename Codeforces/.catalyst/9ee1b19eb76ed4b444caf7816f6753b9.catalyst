That is, the width of the kitchen is $$$w$$$ tiles, and the height is $$$h$$$ tiles. As each tile can be rotated in one of four ways, he still needs to decide on how exactly he will tile the floor. There is a single aesthetic criterion that he wants to fulfil: two adjacent tiles must not share a colour on the edge&#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;i.e. one of the tiles must have a white colour on the shared border, and the second one must be black.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/066d766eadf99ef79fd64c88534b915bb49ea754.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\">   <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">The picture on the left shows one valid tiling of a $$$3 \\times 2$$$ kitchen.
