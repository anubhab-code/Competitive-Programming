Finding all powerful substrings (by substring Volodya means a subsequence of consecutive characters in a string) in a given text makes our hero especially joyful. Recently he felt an enormous fit of energy while reading a certain text. So Volodya decided to count all powerful substrings in this text and brag about it all day long. Help him in this difficult task.
