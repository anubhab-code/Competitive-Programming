We will assume that three identical letters together is a typo (for example, word &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">helllo</span>&quot; contains a typo). Besides, a couple of identical letters immediately followed by another couple of identical letters is a typo too (for example, words &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">helloo</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">wwaatt</span>&quot; contain typos).</p><p>Write a code that deletes the minimum number of letters from a word, correcting described typos in the word.
